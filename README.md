<h3> Descritpion </h3>
People like him were said to be not people, but demons enchanted in human bodies. Driven obsessively by 
love for three women, the character cursed by the witches will know neither peace nor respite 
as long as he resists the fate that preys on him. Taken from death, he will stop at nothing 
in search of the one he loves as only a father can. <br>
A fast-paced story, aspiring to the scale of The Lord of the Rings in temperament, but
told in a mood of dangerous Vikings, mysterious witchers, exotic Amazons and unleavened Kajko and Kokosz. 
<h3> Used technologies </h3>
ES6+ features, BEM
